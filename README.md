# Diction

⚡ R&D in progress

## Description

Diction is an experimental modal logic engine for emergent storytelling and narrative generation. The project is still at the conceptual stage, so don’t expect anything too advanced or spectacular just yet.

The long term goal is to provide a library/API for embedding in games and apps, but right now, it’s really mostly about exploring the design space and seeing what kinds of APIs and DSL approaches might work best.

More info soon.

## Download

⚠️ Don’t expect this to work. It doesn’t have a high level interface yet.
